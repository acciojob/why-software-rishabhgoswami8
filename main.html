    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
    I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve problems and improve people's lives. As a software developer, I would have the opportunity to work on projects that make a difference, whether it's creating a new app that helps people stay organized, or developing a website that makes it easier for people to access important information. Additionally, I am excited about the constant learning opportunities and the ability to stay up to date with the latest technologies. I am drawn to the creativity and problem-solving skills required in this field, and I believe that a career as a software developer would be both challenging and rewarding.
